# Real-Time-Anomaly-Detection-with-Isolation-Forest
This repository contains a Python implementation for real-time anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It dynamically detects outliers in a continuous data stream and visualizes the results in real time, making it ideal for monitoring systems, detecting fraud, and identifying unusual patterns.
